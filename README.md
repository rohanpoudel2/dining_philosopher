# Dining Philosopher Problem Simulation

This project contains scripts to simulate the Dining Philosopher Problem, a classic synchronization problem in computer science.

## Introduction
The Dining Philosopher Problem involves philosophers sitting at a table with a fork between each pair. Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat when they have both left and right forks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
Run the simulation script:
```sh
python3 main.py
```
